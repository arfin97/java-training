[abstract]
Ant, Maven and Gradle are the most popular build tools in Java platform.
Almost every java projects now-a-days builds on either Maven nor Gradle.
Although Ant solves different problems, serves different purpose, many projects still leverage the benefits of Ant.
In this article Maven and Gradle's structure described side by side.
Developer will find useful code snippet and resources for getting start.

== Brief History

Ant::

First released 19 July 2000 <<bb-ant>>.
Built on top of `Java` and `XML`.
Developer needs to explicitly code everything.

Maven::

Maven uses convention over configuration in their builds.
It reduces explicit coding for the developers.
Written in `Java` and working with POM (Project Object Model) based `XML`.
It also supports `C#`, `Ruby`, `Scala`, and other languages.
First released 13 July 2004 <<bb-maven>>.


Gradle::

Gradle first released 2007. Written in Java, Kotlin, Groovy <<bb-gradle>>.
Gradle also used convention over configuration.

== Convention over Configuration

Maven and Gradle both uses convention over configuration.
During project auto generation Maven generates a folder structure and expects the same folder structure during build process.
Gradle also expects almost same folder structure during its build process.
